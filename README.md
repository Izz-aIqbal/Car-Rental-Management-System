Car Rental Management System (C++)

The Car Rental Management System is a console-based project built in C++ that simulates the process of renting cars and generating invoices. It is designed to help understand the concepts of conditional statements, loops, arrays, and input/output formatting in C++.This system allows customers to select a car from available options, provide their details, and rent the car for a specific number of days. Based on the car model (old or new), different rental rates are applied, and a professional invoice is generated. The system also ensures that cars already rented cannot be rented again until their data is reset, preventing double bookings.

Key Features
Input and manage customer details
Multiple car options: Tesla, Hyundai, Ford
Different rental rates for old vs. new models
Calculation of rental fee based on model year and rental duration
Auto-generated invoice with:
Customer name
Car model and number
Number of days rented
Total rental amount
Car availability check to avoid double bookings
Option to delete/reset rental data for cars

Technologies Used
C++ – Core programming language
Standard Library (iostream, iomanip) – Input/output operations and formatting

Learning Outcomes
Practical implementation of decision-making (if-else, switch)
Usage of loops, arrays, and string handling
Generating formatted console output with invoice-style formatting
Problem-solving approach to car availability management

Future Enhancements
Add file handling for storing customer and rental records persistently
Create an Admin Dashboard to track rental history
Implement a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for better usability
Extend to include more cars and pricing options

This project is an excellent demonstration of how C++ can be used to build real-world applications with simple logic and structured programming concepts. It provides a foundation for more advanced management systems by integrating features like data storage, GUI, and database connectivity.
